# Javascript-Mini-Projects
A short list of my first javascript mini projects, using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript

The list of mini projects:
2. Counter 2
3. Responsive Navbar
4. Modal Windows or box
5. FAQ Page
6. Background video
7. Restaurant Menu
8. Calculator.

These were created by me in 2021, representing my initial steps in JavaScript. As you can see, there is still much room for improvement and optimization. Nevertheless, I wanted to share them exactly as they were created, allowing me to track my progress in this programming language.
